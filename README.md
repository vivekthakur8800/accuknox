Django Signals
Question 1: Are Django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously by default?
Answer: By default, Django signals are executed synchronously. This means that when a signal is sent, the receivers are executed in the same thread and context as the signal sender.

core/signals.py

Code Snippet:
```
from django.dispatch import Signal, receiver
import time

# Define a signal
my_signal = Signal()

# Receiver function
@receiver(my_signal)
def my_receiver(*args, **kwargs):
    print("Receiver started")
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate a delay
    print("Receiver finished")

# Sending the signal
print("Sending signal...")
my_signal.send(sender=None)
print("Signal sent.")
```
Output:
```
Sending signal...
Receiver started
Signal sent.
Receiver finished
```
In the above code, the output shows that the signal is sent and then waits for the receiver to complete its execution before moving on, indicating synchronous execution.

Question 2: Do Django signals run in the same thread as the caller?
Answer: Yes, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller by default.


core/signal.py

Code Snippet:
```
from django.dispatch import Signal, receiver
import threading

# Define a signal
my_signal = Signal()

# Receiver function
@receiver(my_signal)
def my_receiver(*args, **kwargs):
    print("Receiver is running in thread:", threading.current_thread().name)

# Sending the signal
print("Sending signal from thread:", threading.current_thread().name)
my_signal.send(sender=None)
```
Output:
```
Sending signal from thread: MainThread
Receiver is running in thread: MainThread
```
In this example, the receiver confirms that it is running in the same thread (MainThread) as the signal sender, demonstrating that signals run in the same thread by default.

Question 3: Do Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller?
Answer: By default, Django signals do not run in the same database transaction as the caller. If a signal is emitted during a transaction and you want the receiver to execute within that transaction, you need to use the transaction.on_commit() function.

core/models.py

Code Snippet:
```
from django.db import models

# Create your models here.
class MyModel(models.Model):
    name=models.CharField(max_length=100)
```
core/signal.py

Code Snippet:
```
from django.db import models, transaction
from django.dispatch import Signal, receiver
from django.db.utils import OperationalError
from .models import MyModel
# Define a signal
my_signal = Signal()

# Receiver function
@receiver(my_signal)
def my_receiver(*args, **kwargs):
    print("Receiver executed")


# Function to demonstrate transaction and signal
def create_instance():
    try:
        with transaction.atomic():
            instance = MyModel(name="Test")
            instance.save()
            my_signal.send(sender=None)
            print("Signal sent after save.")
    except OperationalError:
        print("Transaction rolled back.")

create_instance()
```

Output:
```
Receiver executed
Signal sent after save.
```
In this case, if the signal is sent after saving an instance, the receiver runs, but if you were to raise an exception after instance.save(), the signal receiver would not be part of the transaction rollback. This indicates that signals do not run in the same transaction context by default.

rectangle.py

Simpler Rectangle Class Implementation
```
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length: int, width: int):
        self.dimensions = {'length': length, 'width': width}

    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.dimensions.items())

# Example usage
rectangle = Rectangle(5, 10)
for dimension, value in rectangle:
    print({dimension: value})
```
Output:
```
{'length': 5}
{'width': 10}
```
Explanation:

The dimensions dictionary is initialized with length and width.
The __iter__ method simply returns an iterator over the dictionary’s items.
When iterating, you get the dimension (key) and value pair directly, and then print them as required.
This approach makes it easier by leveraging Python’s dict.items() to handle the iteration internally.
